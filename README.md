# Project: Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

**Author:** *Completed independently by Ivan Shelest*

**Based on DataCamp project:** [Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1876)

## Description

Los Angeles, California â€” a vibrant and diverse city that attracts people from all over the world, offering endless opportunities... not all of them good ones.

In this project, you will act as a **data detective** helping the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)** analyze real crime data. The goal is to provide insights that can help the department allocate resources more effectively and make the city a safer place.

---

## Objectives

Tasks in this project include:

1. **Identify the hour with the highest frequency of crimes.**

   * Store the result as an integer variable called `peak_crime_hour`.

2. **Determine which area has the highest frequency of night crimes.**

   * Night crimes are defined as incidents occurring between **10:00 PM and 3:59 AM**.
   * Save the result as a string variable called `peak_night_crime_location`.

3. **Analyze victim age groups.**

   * Categorize victims into predefined age groups and count the number of crimes for each group.
   * Save this data as a pandas Series called `victim_ages`, where the index corresponds to age group labels and the values represent the number of crimes.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains detailed information about reported crimes in Los Angeles. Below are the key columns used in this project:

## Analytical Tasks in Python

Each step of the analysis was implemented using **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib/seaborn**.

**Tasks implemented:**

```python
# 1. Peak crime hour
peak_crime_hour = crimes.groupby('hour')['DR_NO'].size().idxmax()

# 2. Area with most night crimes (22:00â€“03:59)
night_time = crimes[(crimes['hour'] >= 22) | (crimes['hour'] <= 3)]
peak_night_crime_location = night_time.groupby('AREA NAME')['DR_NO'].size().idxmax()

# 3. Crimes by victim age group
age_labels = ["0-17", "18-25", "26-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"]
age_bins = [0, 17, 25, 34, 44, 54, 64, 100]
crimes['Age Group'] = pd.cut(crimes['Vict Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels, right=True)
victim_ages = crimes.groupby('Age Group')['DR_NO'].count()
```

## Example Output

```
Hour with the largest volume of crimes: 12
Area with the highest frequency of night crimes: Central

Crimes committed against victims of different age groups:
0-17      4528
18-25    28291
26-34    47470
35-44    42157
45-54    28353
55-64    20169
65+      14747
Name: DR_NO, dtype: int64
```

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.12**
* **pandas** â€” data manipulation
* **numpy** â€” numerical operations
* **matplotlib / seaborn** â€” data visualization
* **VS Code** â€” development environment

---

## Key Insights
